slider
======

A Slider is a graphical user interface that allows a user to select a value from a given range of values by dragging the slider knob, or button. A slider is preferred when the user is likely to alter the value of a parameter, or a configuration, frequently in order to analyse its effect on a system. For instance, adjusting the hue of a visual object by varying its RGB channels is faster using a slider than it is by setting the values manually.

A slider is also preferred when it would be cumbersome to enter the required value manually. For instance, it makes more intuitive sense to adjust the volume on a multimedia application using a slider than it is by setting the required decibels manually.

In this project, we implement a slider user interface in Javascript.
